      THE STRAW, THE COAL, AND THE BEAN
    </h2>
<p>
      In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish of
      beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and that
      it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw. When
      she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her observing
      it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards a burning
      coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw began and said:
      ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?’ The coal replied: ‘I
      fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped by sheer
      force, my death would have been certain,—I should have been burnt to
      ashes.’ The bean said: ‘I too have escaped with a whole skin, but if the
      old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made into broth
      without any mercy, like my comrades.’ ‘And would a better fate have fallen
      to my lot?’ said the straw. ‘The old woman has destroyed all my brethren
      in fire and smoke; she seized sixty of them at once, and took their lives.
      I luckily slipped through her fingers.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But what are we to do now?’ said the coal.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I think,’ answered the bean, ‘that as we have so fortunately escaped
      death, we should keep together like good companions, and lest a new
      mischance should overtake us here, we should go away together, and repair
      to a foreign country.’
    </p>
<p>
      The proposition pleased the two others, and they set out on their way
      together. Soon, however, they came to a little brook, and as there was no
      bridge or foot-plank, they did not know how they were to get over it. The
      straw hit on a good idea, and said: ‘I will lay myself straight across,
      and then you can walk over on me as on a bridge.’ The straw therefore
      stretched itself from one bank to the other, and the coal, who was of an
      impetuous disposition, tripped quite boldly on to the newly-built bridge.
      But when she had reached the middle, and heard the water rushing beneath
      her, she was after all, afraid, and stood still, and ventured no farther.
      The straw, however, began to burn, broke in two pieces, and fell into the
      stream. The coal slipped after her, hissed when she got into the water,
      and breathed her last. The bean, who had prudently stayed behind on the
      shore, could not but laugh at the event, was unable to stop, and laughed
      so heartily that she burst. It would have been all over with her,
      likewise, if, by good fortune, a tailor who was travelling in search of
      work, had not sat down to rest by the brook. As he had a compassionate
      heart he pulled out his needle and thread, and sewed her together. The
      bean thanked him most prettily, but as the tailor used black thread, all
      beans since then have a black seam.
