      MOTHER HOLLE
    </h2>
<p>
      Once upon a time there was a widow who had two daughters; one of them was
      beautiful and industrious, the other ugly and lazy. The mother, however,
      loved the ugly and lazy one best, because she was her own daughter, and so
      the other, who was only her stepdaughter, was made to do all the work of
      the house, and was quite the Cinderella of the family. Her stepmother sent
      her out every day to sit by the well in the high road, there to spin until
      she made her fingers bleed. Now it chanced one day that some blood fell on
      to the spindle, and as the girl stopped over the well to wash it off, the
      spindle suddenly sprang out of her hand and fell into the well. She ran
      home crying to tell of her misfortune, but her stepmother spoke harshly to
      her, and after giving her a violent scolding, said unkindly, ‘As you have
      let the spindle fall into the well you may go yourself and fetch it out.’
    </p>
<p>
      The girl went back to the well not knowing what to do, and at last in her
      distress she jumped into the water after the spindle.
    </p>
<p>
      She remembered nothing more until she awoke and found herself in a
      beautiful meadow, full of sunshine, and with countless flowers blooming in
      every direction.
    </p>
<p>
      She walked over the meadow, and presently she came upon a baker’s oven
      full of bread, and the loaves cried out to her, ‘Take us out, take us out,
      or alas! we shall be burnt to a cinder; we were baked through long ago.’
      So she took the bread-shovel and drew them all out.
    </p>
<p>
      She went on a little farther, till she came to a tree full of apples.
      ‘Shake me, shake me, I pray,’ cried the tree; ‘my apples, one and all, are
      ripe.’ So she shook the tree, and the apples came falling down upon her
      like rain; but she continued shaking until there was not a single apple
      left upon it. Then she carefully gathered the apples together in a heap
      and walked on again.
    </p>
<p>
      The next thing she came to was a little house, and there she saw an old
      woman looking out, with such large teeth, that she was terrified, and
      turned to run away. But the old woman called after her, ‘What are you
      afraid of, dear child? Stay with me; if you will do the work of my house
      properly for me, I will make you very happy. You must be very careful,
      however, to make my bed in the right way, for I wish you always to shake
      it thoroughly, so that the feathers fly about; then they say, down there
      in the world, that it is snowing; for I am Mother Holle.’ The old woman
      spoke so kindly, that the girl summoned up courage and agreed to enter
      into her service.
    </p>
<p>
      She took care to do everything according to the old woman’s bidding and
      every time she made the bed she shook it with all her might, so that the
      feathers flew about like so many snowflakes. The old woman was as good as
      her word: she never spoke angrily to her, and gave her roast and boiled
      meats every day.
    </p>
<p>
      So she stayed on with Mother Holle for some time, and then she began to
      grow unhappy. She could not at first tell why she felt sad, but she became
      conscious at last of great longing to go home; then she knew she was
      homesick, although she was a thousand times better off with Mother Holle
      than with her mother and sister. After waiting awhile, she went to Mother
      Holle and said, ‘I am so homesick, that I cannot stay with you any longer,
      for although I am so happy here, I must return to my own people.’
    </p>
<p>
      Then Mother Holle said, ‘I am pleased that you should want to go back to
      your own people, and as you have served me so well and faithfully, I will
      take you home myself.’
    </p>
<p>
      Thereupon she led the girl by the hand up to a broad gateway. The gate was
      opened, and as the girl passed through, a shower of gold fell upon her,
      and the gold clung to her, so that she was covered with it from head to
      foot.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘That is a reward for your industry,’ said Mother Holle, and as she spoke
      she handed her the spindle which she had dropped into the well.
    </p>
<p>
      The gate was then closed, and the girl found herself back in the old world
      close to her mother’s house. As she entered the courtyard, the cock who
      was perched on the well, called out:
    </p>
<pre>
 ‘Cock-a-doodle-doo!
  Your golden daughter’s come back to you.’
</pre>
<p>
      Then she went in to her mother and sister, and as she was so richly
      covered with gold, they gave her a warm welcome. She related to them all
      that had happened, and when the mother heard how she had come by her great
      riches, she thought she should like her ugly, lazy daughter to go and try
      her fortune. So she made the sister go and sit by the well and spin, and
      the girl pricked her finger and thrust her hand into a thorn-bush, so that
      she might drop some blood on to the spindle; then she threw it into the
      well, and jumped in herself.
    </p>
<p>
      Like her sister she awoke in the beautiful meadow, and walked over it till
      she came to the oven. ‘Take us out, take us out, or alas! we shall be
      burnt to a cinder; we were baked through long ago,’ cried the loaves as
      before. But the lazy girl answered, ‘Do you think I am going to dirty my
      hands for you?’ and walked on.
    </p>
<p>
      Presently she came to the apple-tree. ‘Shake me, shake me, I pray; my
      apples, one and all, are ripe,’ it cried. But she only answered, ‘A nice
      thing to ask me to do, one of the apples might fall on my head,’ and
      passed on.
    </p>
<p>
      At last she came to Mother Holle’s house, and as she had heard all about
      the large teeth from her sister, she was not afraid of them, and engaged
      herself without delay to the old woman.
    </p>
<p>
      The first day she was very obedient and industrious, and exerted herself
      to please Mother Holle, for she thought of the gold she should get in
      return. The next day, however, she began to dawdle over her work, and the
      third day she was more idle still; then she began to lie in bed in the
      mornings and refused to get up. Worse still, she neglected to make the old
      woman’s bed properly, and forgot to shake it so that the feathers might
      fly about. So Mother Holle very soon got tired of her, and told her she
      might go. The lazy girl was delighted at this, and thought to herself,
      ‘The gold will soon be mine.’ Mother Holle led her, as she had led her
      sister, to the broad gateway; but as she was passing through, instead of
      the shower of gold, a great bucketful of pitch came pouring over her.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘That is in return for your services,’ said the old woman, and she shut
      the gate.
    </p>
<p>
      So the lazy girl had to go home covered with pitch, and the cock on the
      well called out as she saw her:
    </p>
<pre>
 ‘Cock-a-doodle-doo!
  Your dirty daughter’s come back to you.’
</pre>
<p>
      But, try what she would, she could not get the pitch off and it stuck to
      her as long as she lived.
