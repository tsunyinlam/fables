      THE GOOSE-GIRL
    </h2>
<p>
      The king of a great land died, and left his queen to take care of their
      only child. This child was a daughter, who was very beautiful; and her
      mother loved her dearly, and was very kind to her. And there was a good
      fairy too, who was fond of the princess, and helped her mother to watch
      over her. When she grew up, she was betrothed to a prince who lived a
      great way off; and as the time drew near for her to be married, she got
      ready to set off on her journey to his country. Then the queen her mother,
      packed up a great many costly things; jewels, and gold, and silver;
      trinkets, fine dresses, and in short everything that became a royal bride.
      And she gave her a waiting-maid to ride with her, and give her into the
      bridegroom’s hands; and each had a horse for the journey. Now the
      princess’s horse was the fairy’s gift, and it was called Falada, and could
      speak.
    </p>
<p>
      When the time came for them to set out, the fairy went into her
      bed-chamber, and took a little knife, and cut off a lock of her hair, and
      gave it to the princess, and said, ‘Take care of it, dear child; for it is
      a charm that may be of use to you on the road.’ Then they all took a
      sorrowful leave of the princess; and she put the lock of hair into her
      bosom, got upon her horse, and set off on her journey to her bridegroom’s
      kingdom.
    </p>
<p>
      One day, as they were riding along by a brook, the princess began to feel
      very thirsty: and she said to her maid, ‘Pray get down, and fetch me some
      water in my golden cup out of yonder brook, for I want to drink.’ ‘Nay,’
      said the maid, ‘if you are thirsty, get off yourself, and stoop down by
      the water and drink; I shall not be your waiting-maid any longer.’ Then
      she was so thirsty that she got down, and knelt over the little brook, and
      drank; for she was frightened, and dared not bring out her golden cup; and
      she wept and said, ‘Alas! what will become of me?’ And the lock answered
      her, and said:
    </p>
<pre>
 ‘Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,
  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’
</pre>
<p>
      But the princess was very gentle and meek, so she said nothing to her
      maid’s ill behaviour, but got upon her horse again.
    </p>
<p>
      Then all rode farther on their journey, till the day grew so warm, and the
      sun so scorching, that the bride began to feel very thirsty again; and at
      last, when they came to a river, she forgot her maid’s rude speech, and
      said, ‘Pray get down, and fetch me some water to drink in my golden cup.’
      But the maid answered her, and even spoke more haughtily than before:
      ‘Drink if you will, but I shall not be your waiting-maid.’ Then the
      princess was so thirsty that she got off her horse, and lay down, and held
      her head over the running stream, and cried and said, ‘What will become of
      me?’ And the lock of hair answered her again:
    </p>
<pre>
 ‘Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,
  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’
</pre>
<p>
      And as she leaned down to drink, the lock of hair fell from her bosom, and
      floated away with the water. Now she was so frightened that she did not
      see it; but her maid saw it, and was very glad, for she knew the charm;
      and she saw that the poor bride would be in her power, now that she had
      lost the hair. So when the bride had done drinking, and would have got
      upon Falada again, the maid said, ‘I shall ride upon Falada, and you may
      have my horse instead’; so she was forced to give up her horse, and soon
      afterwards to take off her royal clothes and put on her maid’s shabby
      ones.
    </p>
<p>
      At last, as they drew near the end of their journey, this treacherous
      servant threatened to kill her mistress if she ever told anyone what had
      happened. But Falada saw it all, and marked it well.
    </p>
<p>
      Then the waiting-maid got upon Falada, and the real bride rode upon the
      other horse, and they went on in this way till at last they came to the
      royal court. There was great joy at their coming, and the prince flew to
      meet them, and lifted the maid from her horse, thinking she was the one
      who was to be his wife; and she was led upstairs to the royal chamber; but
      the true princess was told to stay in the court below.
    </p>
<p>
      Now the old king happened just then to have nothing else to do; so he
      amused himself by sitting at his kitchen window, looking at what was going
      on; and he saw her in the courtyard. As she looked very pretty, and too
      delicate for a waiting-maid, he went up into the royal chamber to ask the
      bride who it was she had brought with her, that was thus left standing in
      the court below. ‘I brought her with me for the sake of her company on the
      road,’ said she; ‘pray give the girl some work to do, that she may not be
      idle.’ The old king could not for some time think of any work for her to
      do; but at last he said, ‘I have a lad who takes care of my geese; she may
      go and help him.’ Now the name of this lad, that the real bride was to
      help in watching the king’s geese, was Curdken.
    </p>
<p>
      But the false bride said to the prince, ‘Dear husband, pray do me one
      piece of kindness.’ ‘That I will,’ said the prince. ‘Then tell one of your
      slaughterers to cut off the head of the horse I rode upon, for it was very
      unruly, and plagued me sadly on the road’; but the truth was, she was very
      much afraid lest Falada should some day or other speak, and tell all she
      had done to the princess. She carried her point, and the faithful Falada
      was killed; but when the true princess heard of it, she wept, and begged
      the man to nail up Falada’s head against a large dark gate of the city,
      through which she had to pass every morning and evening, that there she
      might still see him sometimes. Then the slaughterer said he would do as
      she wished; and cut off the head, and nailed it up under the dark gate.
    </p>
<p>
      Early the next morning, as she and Curdken went out through the gate, she
      said sorrowfully:
    </p>
<pre>
 ‘Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!’
</pre>
<p>
      and the head answered:
    </p>
<pre>
 ‘Bride, bride, there thou gangest!
  Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,
  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’
</pre>
<p>
      Then they went out of the city, and drove the geese on. And when she came
      to the meadow, she sat down upon a bank there, and let down her waving
      locks of hair, which were all of pure silver; and when Curdken saw it
      glitter in the sun, he ran up, and would have pulled some of the locks
      out, but she cried:
    </p>
<pre>
 ‘Blow, breezes, blow!
  Let Curdken’s hat go!
  Blow, breezes, blow!
  Let him after it go!
  O’er hills, dales, and rocks,
  Away be it whirl’d
  Till the silvery locks
  Are all comb’d and curl’d!
</pre>
<p>
      Then there came a wind, so strong that it blew off Curdken’s hat; and away
      it flew over the hills: and he was forced to turn and run after it; till,
      by the time he came back, she had done combing and curling her hair, and
      had put it up again safe. Then he was very angry and sulky, and would not
      speak to her at all; but they watched the geese until it grew dark in the
      evening, and then drove them homewards.
    </p>
<p>
      The next morning, as they were going through the dark gate, the poor girl
      looked up at Falada’s head, and cried:
    </p>
<pre>
 ‘Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!’
</pre>
<p>
      and the head answered:
    </p>
<pre>
 ‘Bride, bride, there thou gangest!
  Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,
  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’
</pre>
<p>
      Then she drove on the geese, and sat down again in the meadow, and began
      to comb out her hair as before; and Curdken ran up to her, and wanted to
      take hold of it; but she cried out quickly:
    </p>
<pre>
 ‘Blow, breezes, blow!
  Let Curdken’s hat go!
  Blow, breezes, blow!
  Let him after it go!
  O’er hills, dales, and rocks,
  Away be it whirl’d
  Till the silvery locks
  Are all comb’d and curl’d!
</pre>
<p>
      Then the wind came and blew away his hat; and off it flew a great way,
      over the hills and far away, so that he had to run after it; and when he
      came back she had bound up her hair again, and all was safe. So they
      watched the geese till it grew dark.
    </p>
<p>
      In the evening, after they came home, Curdken went to the old king, and
      said, ‘I cannot have that strange girl to help me to keep the geese any
      longer.’ ‘Why?’ said the king. ‘Because, instead of doing any good, she
      does nothing but tease me all day long.’ Then the king made him tell him
      what had happened. And Curdken said, ‘When we go in the morning through
      the dark gate with our flock of geese, she cries and talks with the head
      of a horse that hangs upon the wall, and says:
    </p>
<pre>
 ‘Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!’
</pre>
<p>
      and the head answers:
    </p>
<pre>
 ‘Bride, bride, there thou gangest!
  Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,
  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’
</pre>
<p>
      And Curdken went on telling the king what had happened upon the meadow
      where the geese fed; how his hat was blown away; and how he was forced to
      run after it, and to leave his flock of geese to themselves. But the old
      king told the boy to go out again the next day: and when morning came, he
      placed himself behind the dark gate, and heard how she spoke to Falada,
      and how Falada answered. Then he went into the field, and hid himself in a
      bush by the meadow’s side; and he soon saw with his own eyes how they
      drove the flock of geese; and how, after a little time, she let down her
      hair that glittered in the sun. And then he heard her say:
    </p>
<pre>
 ‘Blow, breezes, blow!
  Let Curdken’s hat go!
  Blow, breezes, blow!
  Let him after it go!
  O’er hills, dales, and rocks,
  Away be it whirl’d
  Till the silvery locks
  Are all comb’d and curl’d!
</pre>
<p>
      And soon came a gale of wind, and carried away Curdken’s hat, and away
      went Curdken after it, while the girl went on combing and curling her
      hair. All this the old king saw: so he went home without being seen; and
      when the little goose-girl came back in the evening he called her aside,
      and asked her why she did so: but she burst into tears, and said, ‘That I
      must not tell you or any man, or I shall lose my life.’
    </p>
<p>
      But the old king begged so hard, that she had no peace till she had told
      him all the tale, from beginning to end, word for word. And it was very
      lucky for her that she did so, for when she had done the king ordered
      royal clothes to be put upon her, and gazed on her with wonder, she was so
      beautiful. Then he called his son and told him that he had only a false
      bride; for that she was merely a waiting-maid, while the true bride stood
      by. And the young king rejoiced when he saw her beauty, and heard how meek
      and patient she had been; and without saying anything to the false bride,
      the king ordered a great feast to be got ready for all his court. The
      bridegroom sat at the top, with the false princess on one side, and the
      true one on the other; but nobody knew her again, for her beauty was quite
      dazzling to their eyes; and she did not seem at all like the little
      goose-girl, now that she had her brilliant dress on.
    </p>
<p>
      When they had eaten and drank, and were very merry, the old king said he
      would tell them a tale. So he began, and told all the story of the
      princess, as if it was one that he had once heard; and he asked the true
      waiting-maid what she thought ought to be done to anyone who would behave
      thus. ‘Nothing better,’ said this false bride, ‘than that she should be
      thrown into a cask stuck round with sharp nails, and that two white horses
      should be put to it, and should drag it from street to street till she was
      dead.’ ‘Thou art she!’ said the old king; ‘and as thou has judged thyself,
      so shall it be done to thee.’ And the young king was then married to his
      true wife, and they reigned over the kingdom in peace and happiness all
      their lives; and the good fairy came to see them, and restored the
      faithful Falada to life again.
